## The License
For most it follows the standard stuff: 
- Don't sue me
- Derivatives must follow this license too (and be open)
- Commercial use allowed
- State changes and disclose source
- Distribution, modification, private use, etc. etc.

BUT if your legal entity meets certain conditions, say... being a multi-million dollar company, you are required to make a minimum contribution, code or monetary, to the developers. 

You may wonder "what about forks?" - thats where the name comes in. If the legal entity pays a fork, some percentage of that goes up, and so on, until they get to the root project.

## License License
This license is licensed under itself. All works using this license must follow this license's license.
